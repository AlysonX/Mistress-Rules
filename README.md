# Mistress-Rules

Hello! If you're reading, that means you're probably interested in becoming my submissive. In this document you will find my general rules I want my subs to follow. More rules will be developped as time goes on and I get to know you more. If you catch my eye, say goodbye to your freedom~


RULES

-You are to Address me as Mistress Alyson or Miss Alyson.

-You are to get on your knees whenever you greet me, then you may stand.

-You are to tell me if I am pushing your limits or if you feel I am not pushing them far enough. (This will improve as we get to know eachother more)

-I will never owner lock you unless you become my full sub or you ask me to.

Please whisper to me "I have read the rules" when you are finished.


ABOUT

As a Mistress I am very strict. I am not the cute Alyson you probably know. I'm Mistress Alyson. I expect to be treated as such. I can be sadistic in my own way. Though I do not enjoy inflicting pain on others, I will use corporal punishment should I see no other way. Otherwise I will break your will until you obey or learn from your mistake.

I want my subs to follow me obediently and I will train you, teach you lessons and turn you into my obedient subbie with ANY means necessary. (Obviously following your limits and my limits) If that isn't your cup of tea, turn away now.
